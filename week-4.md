# Week 4

During week 1 and 2, we saw that deployment is hard. We need to do multiple things to deploy a website:

- handle python versions and virtual env
- install nginx
- install MySQL
- install gunicorn

All of these need to be done manually. What if we can write a shell script to do all these stuff? That is what Docker does.
